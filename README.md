# Pulse-Rate-BPM-Monitor-using-Arduino-Pulse-Sensor
In this project, I interfaced Pulse Sensor with Arduino to Measure Pulse Rate (BPM) or Heart Beat value. The Pulse rate will be displayed on 16Ã—2 LCD Display.

The Heartbeat BPM Sensing Project with Arduino Uno aims to develop a cost-effective and efficient system for monitoring and measuring heart rate using the Arduino Uno microcontroller. The project focuses on providing a reliable and user-friendly solution for real-time monitoring of heartbeats, with potential applications in healthcare, fitness, and wellness tracking.
 
The system utilizes a pulse rate sensor interfaced with the Arduino Uno to capture the heartbeat data. The Arduino Uno processes the sensor input and employs signal processing techniques to calculate the beats per minute (BPM) accurately. The obtained BPM data is then displayed on an output device, providing instant feedback to the user.
 
The project involves a comprehensive study of the hardware and software components, including the selection and integration of the pulse rate sensor, Arduino Uno microcontroller, and display module. The software aspect involves programming the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE, implementing the logic to analyze the sensor data, and presenting the BPM information in a clear and understandable format.
 
Results from testing and validation showcase the effectiveness and accuracy of the system in measuring and displaying heart rate information. The project's focus on affordability, simplicity, and portability makes it an attractive solution for various applications, including personal health monitoring, exercise regimens, and medical diagnostics.
 
The Heartbeat BPM Sensing Project with Arduino Uno presents a practical and accessible approach to heart rate monitoring, bridging the gap between technology and healthcare. This abstract provides a glimpse into the project's objectives, methodology, and potential impact, highlighting its significance in the domain of health and wellness monitoring.
